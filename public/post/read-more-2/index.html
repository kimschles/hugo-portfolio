      <article class="post-content">
      <p>At the beginning of July 2017, I set out to increase how much I read each month. It has been 28 days, and thus far I&rsquo;ve fallen short of my goal, so I&rsquo;m reflecting on my progress and making changes so I can keep reading.</p>
<h3 id="original-goal-and-progress">Original Goal and Progress</h3>
<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/kimschlesinger/image/upload/v1532227598/complete-tracker.png" alt="Complete tracker"></p>
<p><strong>My goal was to read 700 minutes in 28 days. I ended up reading 550 minutes in 28 days.</strong></p>
<h3 id="insights">Insights</h3>
<ul>
<li>25 minutes of uninterrupted reading is a stretch for me. I usually want to look at my phone or open my computer after 10 minutes of reading.</li>
<li>The quality of my reading comprehension varies day by day, which is okay because I’m focused more on establishing the habit as opposed to how well I understand what I read.</li>
<li>I set up an <a href="http://heathbrothers.com/switch-paths/im-trying-to-change-things-in-my-own-life/4-research-backed-tips-sticking-new-years-resolutions/">‘action trigger’</a> by reading during my bus ride home. This worked well for me, but I didn&rsquo;t have plan for when I drive to work or during the weekends. For example, I didn’t ride the bus very much during the week of July 16-22, and I only read three times that week.</li>
<li>I need a public tracker that my housemates or colleagues can see. Having it on my website doesn’t provide enough accountability.</li>
<li>Expecting myself to read 7 days a week is too much. I will reduce it to 5 days a week during the second-half of my project.</li>
<li>Even though I fell short of my goal, I read <em>a lot</em> more in July than I did in June.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="revised-goal">Revised Goal</h3>
<p><strong>My Goal:</strong> Read 25 minutes 5 times per week or 125 minutes per week</p>
<p><strong>My reading list</strong> <a href="/reading-list">lives here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Here&rsquo;s the new tracker that is on the door of my bedroom:</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/kimschlesinger/image/upload/v1532227453/new_tracker.jpg" alt="A more public reading tracker"></p>
<p><strong>I will reflect and publish my final reflection on September 10, 2017.</strong></p>
