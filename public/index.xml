      <description>This is a companion blog post for a presentation I gave at the February 2020 DenverScript Meetup.
You can find the video recording and slide deck on my talks page.
The Path Variable   PATH is an enviornment variable.
  The variable is a colon-delimited string. The directory before each colon contains executable code and is invoked through a command, like pwd.
  To see the value, run echo $PATH from your command line</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m an technologist and educator.
Currently, I am a Site Reliability Engineer at Fairwinds Ops, and the Head of Education and Content for Develop Denver.
Previously, I cofounded diversity, and I was an Instructor and Curriculum Designer for the Web Development Program at Galvanize, a codeschool based in Denver, Colorado.
Before tech, I was an elementary school special education teacher and instructional coach.
I love gravelbiking, exploring new hiking and biking trails in Southern Colorado and listening to the You&amp;rsquo;re Wrong About podcast.</description>
