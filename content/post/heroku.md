[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) is the simplest way I know to deploy an application that requries read and write access to a database, like you would need for an API that can do CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Destroy). 

By the end of this tutorial, you will see how to: 
1. Set up an application on Heroku
1. Provision a postgres DB on Heroku
1. Run knex commands to create the schema and seed a production database



* Here's a github gist with the commands: [https://gist.github.com/kimschles/5001ee44e25c754f26d752b8f16cc287](https://gist.github.com/kimschles/5001ee44e25c754f26d752b8f16cc287)
* This is the application repo if you don't want to write code for your own API: [https://github.com/kimschles/books-read-api](https://github.com/kimschles/books-read-api)
