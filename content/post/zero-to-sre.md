In the Spring of 2019, I spent a lot of time writing and giving a talk called [Zero to SRE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEVssm9VqtA). Here are two blog posts from my company that cover the content of that talk: 

* [How To Invest In Junior Engineers](https://www.fairwinds.com/thoughts/zero-to-sre-how-to-invest-in-junior-engineers)
* [Day One for Your Junior Engineer](https://www.fairwinds.com/thoughts/zero-to-sre-day-one-for-your-junior-engineer)
