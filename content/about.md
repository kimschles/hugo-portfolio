I am a technologist and educator, and I currently work as a Developer Advocate at [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/). If you're  curious about my work, please check out [tech education work samples](https://kimschlesinger.com/work-samples/).

Before DigitalOcean, I was a Site Reliability Engineer at [Fairwinds Ops](https://www.fairwinds.com/), I spent two years as the Head of Education and Content for [Develop Denver](https://developdenver.org/), and I was an instructor and curriculum designer at Galvanize, a codeschool based in Denver, Colorado. 

Before tech, I was an elementary school special education teacher and instructional coach. 

Outside of work, I enjoy hiking and biking on trails in Southern Colorado and listening to the [Maintenance Phase](https://www.maintenancephase.com/) podcast.
