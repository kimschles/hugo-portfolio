I am a technologist and educator. 

Currently, I work as a Site Reliability Engineer at [Fairwinds Ops](https://www.fairwinds.com/). 

Previously, I was the Head of Education and Content for [Develop Denver](https://developdenver.org/), I cofounded [diversity](https://hirediversity.us/), and 
I was an instructor and curriculum designer at Galvanize, a codeschool based in Denver, Colorado. 

Before tech, I was an elementary school special education teacher and instructional coach. 

I love weight lifting, exploring hiking and biking trails in Southern Colorado and listening to the [You're Wrong About](https://yourewrongabout.com/) podcast.
