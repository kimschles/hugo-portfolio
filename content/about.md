![Kim Schlesinger talking to a conference audience in front of the Develop Denver logo.](https://res.cloudinary.com/kimschlesinger/image/upload/c_scale,w_550/v1606362929/00044_DVLP2019.jpg)

I am a technologist and educator, and right now I'm taking a break between jobs. 

I've worked as a Site Reliability Engineer at [Fairwinds Ops](https://www.fairwinds.com/), I've been the Head of Education and Content for [Develop Denver](https://developdenver.org/), I cofounded [diversity](https://hirediversity.us/), and I was an instructor and curriculum designer at Galvanize, a codeschool based in Denver, Colorado. 

Before tech, I was an elementary school special education teacher and instructional coach. 

I love weight lifting, exploring hiking and biking trails in Southern Colorado and listening to the [You're Wrong About](https://yourewrongabout.com/) podcast.  

I'm documenting some of my favorite tech resources [here](/recommended-resources). Feel free to check it out.
